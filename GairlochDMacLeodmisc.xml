          <orth>gobhlag</orth>
        </form>
        <def>The confusion over “gobhlag” seems to have arisen through a wrong spelling. Did I really have “goblag” in the paper? It is in fact the “graip” of every Highland croft. I was surprised to
          find it included among the implements used locally because farther north it would be considered “sloppy” work to have to resort to this. (‘o’ as in ‘bó’) [NOTES: the paper Mr MacLeod refers
          to is most probably the peat questionnaire of Sgoil Achadh a’ Chairn (Auchtercairn School).]</def>

          <orth>rughan Frangach</orth>
        </form>
        <def>“Rughan Frangach” is more complicated. It would seem to be the “learner’s” or “stranger’s” or “foreigner’s” way of making a “rughan”. These amateurs would use the easy method of laying
          the peat lengthwise instead of on end as in the proper “rughan”. So a child might be told when his “rughan” keeps falling in – “Dean rughan Frangach”. The name is not in common use now
          however. (I find the local staff know it – delete last sentence.) [NOTES: again, the term appears in the above-mentioned peat questionnaire.]</def>
